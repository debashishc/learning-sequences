- char level
    - spell checker for words 
    	- percentage indicates
    - freq of short words in human authored text vs generated
    - bi gram and n-gram

- hyperparameters of the lstm in the keras
	- 
- extrapolate (change size of dataset)
	- changing size of data increases epoch time proportionally
		- doubling the data appx. doubles the time
	- changing units increases exponentially
		- 256 -> 512 increases training time from ~17 to ~53 mins
- measuring novelty of the text (edit-distance)
- find the most similar sentence in a text with the generated text

- summary statistic of sentence 
    - similar word count
    - consider scalability
    - only conform to training dataset

obtain ways to measure the output
    - freq of common words
    - spell check



- lstm hyperparameters

- word level
	- issue with large dataset
		- spanish data set converges to repeating words
