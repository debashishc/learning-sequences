# Sequence modelling 

Applying deep learning architectures to model sequences such as natural language, audio etc towards language modelling and generation.  

Deep learning architectures in use:
 - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
 - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
 - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU, possibly)
